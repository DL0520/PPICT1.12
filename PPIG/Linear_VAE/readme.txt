Here is the graph encoding folder of Linear _ VAE.
It is mainly composed of two parts, one is the graph structure file composed of Cross-talk and the cross-talk extracted by SDNE. The other part is Linear _ VAE training optimization function folder ( Linear _ gae ).

Cross-talk: 
The folder contains the adjacency matrix file ( Cross-talk _ Matrix.txt ) of the graph structure composed of cross-talk and the protein features in PPIs extracted by SDNE ( SDNE _ 128. npy ). 
These two will be the initial input files of Linear _ VAE training optimization.

linear_gae:
All python code packages required for Linear _ VAE training optimization are included here.
