1.The PPIs between 86 proteins used in Inter were searched in String database. 
2.Since SDNE can carry node features, we take the sequence features of proteins extracted from FEGS as the input original features of each node ( protein ). 
3.Extract the protein features we need after encoding PPIs.

input: PPIs graph and Protein features extracted by FEGS. (./Graph_Datasets/PPIs/)
output: Protein features matrix. (./Latent_Representation)
