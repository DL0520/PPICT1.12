It is mainly used to store PDB and UniprotID fasta sequence files .

Note:

All_protein_fasta.fasta: the file format for calculating protein sequences features in FEGS.
pdb_fastas: sequence fasta found from a PDB structure file that removes missing sites.
uniprot_fastas: download in Uniprot website.
uniprot_pdbchain_fastas: one-to-one correspondence between uniprot and its pdbchain facilitates access to sequence and structural features at a site.
